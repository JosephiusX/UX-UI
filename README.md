              -  i can comment and tag team members
              -  i can write sticky notes with different colors and bold text
              -  cntr + 2finger-swipe is a good way to zoom in and out
              -  space + 2finger-swipe moves the frame around
              - the connector allows us to connect notes together(good for diagrams)
              - space bar allows hand properties
              - text tool allows me to write headings
              - zoom out and select everything to group it together using the group button

38.   Figma Plugin and Community

                  -  to access plugins:
                      user Icon > plugins > Browse plugins

                  - to use a plugin: Maaterial Design Icons for example
                      click it > duplicate it

from there i can go to filled to view the icons. they are installed on my project and they are turned into components.

                - go back using icon in upper left
                - drag material design Icons over to Udemy project

another way to install plugins is to select the community tab. I can pick from the optins I see below or search plugins in the search box.

                - search and install 'cover status' plugin.

this plugin will allow me to make cover pages very quickly.

                - in my Udemy project create a new design file named test plugin
                - Help button > keyboard shortcuts
                - to use plugin search menu:
                        'ctrl + /' then search cover Status
                - fill out text and press create
                - on the page it created , right click the box surrounding the text and select 'set it to thumbnail'.
