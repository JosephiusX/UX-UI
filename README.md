38.   Figma Plugin and Community

                  -  to access plugins:
                      user Icon > plugins > Browse plugins

                  - to use a plugin: Maaterial Design Icons for example
                      click it > duplicate it

from there i can go to filled to view the icons. they are installed on my project and they are turned into components.

                - go back using icon in upper left
                - drag material design Icons over to Udemy project

another way to install plugins is to select the community tab. I can pick from the optins I see below or search plugins in the search box.

                - search and install 'cover status' plugin.

this plugin will allow me to make cover pages very quickly.

                - in my Udemy project create a new design file named test plugin
                - Help button > keyboard shortcuts
                - to use plugin search menu:
                        'ctrl + /' then search cover Status
                - fill out text and press create
                - on the page it created , right click the box surrounding the text and select 'set it to thumbnail'.
