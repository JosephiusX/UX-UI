37.   Figma Basics

              -  i can comment and tag team members
              -  i can write sticky notes with different colors and bold text
              -  cntr + 2finger-swipe is a good way to zoom in and out
              -  space + 2finger-swipe moves the frame around
              - the connector allows us to connect notes together(good for diagrams)
              - space bar allows hand properties
              - text tool allows me to write headings
              - zoom out and select everything to group it together using the group button

38.   Figma Plugin and Community

                  -  to access plugins:
                      user Icon > plugins > Browse plugins

                  - to use a plugin: Maaterial Design Icons for example
                      click it > duplicate it

from there i can go to filled to view the icons. they are installed on my project and they are turned into components.

                - go back using icon in upper left
                - drag material design Icons over to Udemy project

another way to install plugins is to select the community tab. I can pick from the optins I see below or search plugins in the search box.

                - search and install 'cover status' plugin.

this plugin will allow me to make cover pages very quickly.

                - in my Udemy project create a new design file named test plugin
                - Help button > keyboard shortcuts
                - to use plugin search menu:
                        'ctrl + /' then search cover Status
                - fill out text and press create
                - on the page it created , right click the box surrounding the text and select 'set it to thumbnail'.

after this exercize we delete this project

39. Affinity and mind mapping.

40. User Persona

Organizing information about the target audience

        to save User persona as a png:
            -group the selection
            -right click and copy as png
            -open a new design file
            -paste png
            -export

i can also save a local copy for sharing

41. Customer journey mapping

# SEC 5 User Interface Design

45. Unity and Similarity

Unity is created when all design elements carry the same weight and look harmonized. When design elements in a composition belong together.

46. Dominance and working memory

Dominance is achieved by emphasizing on one design element. Dominance grabs users attention to one design element on the webpage.

        - a primary buttion like Add should be filled as it draws more imphasis.
        - a secondary button like cancel should just be text or outlined to be deemphasize

47. Negative Space and Complexity

Negative space is created when unnessessary design elements are removed, and the area of the layout that is left empty to increase contrast.

51.   Psychological Bariar and Proportion

          golden ration Proportion:
              .618

52.   Figma Essential Behaviors

                - we start by opening a design file instead of a fig-jam file.
                - Duplicate selection:
                              ctrl + D

If we try to export our doughnut it shows as 2 items to be exported which isint what we want. Before we export, we need to group the selection.

                - Group selection:
                               ctrl + G

Now when we export , it is as a single item.

If we undo that grouping theres another way we can achieve this

        - wrap the parts of the doughnut in a frame
                - the frame acts as a group as well

difference between group and frame?

        with a grouping the position of the object adapts to changing border size
                - stays centered
                - grows with box

        with frames the movement dosent adjust the content and the frame can even cover some of it up.
                - moves based on alignment
                - dosent change size

        download 'sort layers' from the plugin community

after duplicating the doughnut in a frame 3 times we select them all then open the plugin menu like so: ctrl + /

                - type in sort layers sort by x position
                - with the boxes selected press 'ctrl + R' to rename the file
                - in rename to box enter '$n '

this will name the frames by number starting with one based on where they are on the x axis

                - zoom to selection:
                        shift + 2

we can stop the frame from clipping by checking the box

                - next we create another page

can adjust layer passthrough for transparency

on the color panel we can turn colors from solid to gradients in the upper left hand corner

                - install lorem

53.   Figma Core Engine Concepts

in a new design file make 2 pages:

                -prototype
                -components

draw 2 squares and select them both and select auto layout

                        - download 'replace layers' plugin from community
                        - download ' reverse layer order' also.

      to reverse the layer order:

                      - select the layer
                      - press enter
                      - ctrl + /
                      - reverse order layer

      what was first is now last.

we can adjust the padding on the left when main is selected
