                  -  to access plugins:

                  - to use a plugin: Maaterial Design Icons for example
                      click it > duplicate it

from there i can go to filled to view the icons. they are installed on my project and they are turned into components.

                - go back using icon in upper left
                - drag material design Icons over to Udemy project

another way to install plugins is to select the community tab. I can pick from the optins I see below or search plugins in the search box.

                - search and install 'cover status' plugin.

this plugin will allow me to make cover pages very quickly.

                - in my Udemy project create a new design file named test plugin
                - Help button > keyboard shortcuts
                - to use plugin search menu:
                        'ctrl + /' then search cover Status
                - fill out text and press create
                - on the page it created , right click the box surrounding the text and select 'set it to thumbnail'.

# SEC 5 User Interface Design

45. Unity and Similarity

Unity is created when all design elements carry the same weight and look harmonized. When design elements in a composition belong together.

46. Dominance and working memory

Dominance is achieved by emphasizing on one design element. Dominance grabs users attention to one design element on the webpage.

        - a primary buttion like Add should be filled as it draws more imphasis.
        - a secondary button like cancel should just be text or outlined to be deemphasize
